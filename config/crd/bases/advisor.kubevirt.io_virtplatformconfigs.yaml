                  WaitTimeout specifies the maximum time to wait for resources to become healthy
                  after applying configuration changes. This is particularly important for
                  high-impact changes like MachineConfig rollouts that can take hours or days
                  on large clusters with many nodes and VMs to migrate.

                  If not set, the controller will wait indefinitely (checking on each reconciliation)
                  until resources become healthy. This is the recommended setting for production
                  clusters where rollout times are unpredictable.

                  If set, the controller will fail items that don't become healthy within this duration.
                  The timeout is measured from when the item enters InProgress state.
